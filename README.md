# Efficient-Quicksort

This program implements efficienter Quicksort Algorithm by ignoring unnecessary recursions.

-Running the test class begins a command prompt which asks for user to choose one of available .csv datas to run and test the algorithm.

-Own datas can be put into the folder "instances".

-SortSelect function uses the naive approach of quicksort and Select function implements the efficient version.

-After finishing testing, program saves the .csv solution in "solutions" folder.

-To evaluate the solution, simply open the plot.html file under "evaluation" folder and upload the solution file there.

-Evaluation function compares solutions SortSelect and Select.
